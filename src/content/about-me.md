I'm Dani, an Argentinian software developer. I'm currently in my last year of
high school, and I'm planning to study Computer Science in the college.

There's some interesting facts about me:

- I've born a 12th of July of 2006, in Buenos Aires, Argentina 🇦🇷
- The first game that I played was
  [Super Mario 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_64) ⭐
- I started programming when I was 10 years old, with
  [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) 🐱‍👤
- My first videogame was a pong clone made with [Love2D](https://love2d.org/) 🎮
