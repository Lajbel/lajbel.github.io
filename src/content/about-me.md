# About me

I'm Dani, an Argentinian software developer. I'm currently in my last year of
high school, and I'm planning to study Computer Science in the college.

## Social Medias

There's all my most-used social medias, where I publish content.

<div class="social-medias">
<a href="https://github.com/lajbel" target="_blank" class="social-media-icon social-media-icon--github"><i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i></a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/lajbel" target="_blank" class="social-media-icon social-media-icon--twitter"><i class="fa-brands fa-x-twitter"></i></a>
</div>

## About this website

This website was made with the idea of being the museum of all my content,
projects and games. It's like my portfolio, my blog and my arcade. It's not
pretty finished, but I'm working on it.

## Services

I'm currently working on some freelance services, like web development and
discord bots.
