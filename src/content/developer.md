I'm a software developer, and I love to make games and websites. I seriously
started to code when I was 13 years old, and I'm still learning new things every
day. Will take a look to my favourite languages, frameworks, and my experience
with them.

## Languages

### Javascript Eco-System

JavaScript was my first true programming language, I learned it when I was 13
for make Discord bots, and after that, I started to make everything with it.
This language is my favourite, and my knowledge about the eco-system is very
big. It includes: **Node.js**, **npm**, **ES6**, **TypeScript**, **React**, and
more.
